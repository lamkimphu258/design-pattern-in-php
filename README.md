# Acknowledge

Thank you Pierre-Emmanuel Manteau from Tekos Interactive because let me know and always give me a chance to learn design
pattern in my early career. I appreciate it.

# Preface

In this repository, I want to share with you my knowledge about design pattern. Design pattern is a topic which does not
depend on specific programming language. For that reason, my approach is that we need to understand a problem first and
how design pattern solve that problem. After that I will implement it in PHP, you can read my code and implement the
same way in your programming language. Since you understand the problem and how to solve it then I think this step is
very easy.
